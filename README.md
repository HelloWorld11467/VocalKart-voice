# 🎯VocalKart-voice
India’s first voice-based rural marketplace that empowers rural vendors and customers to buy and sell using simple voice interactions, without needing app literacy.

# 💡Problem Statement
In many rural and underserved regions, small-scale vendors and informal sellers face significant challenges in adopting digital platforms due to:

Limited literacy and technical skills

Language barriers and regional dialects

Inability to create structured product listings

Exclusion from the digital economy

Current Challenges
Traditional catalog systems require text-based inputs
No support for voice-based product listing creation
Difficulties in handling regional languages and dialects
Complex interfaces with steep learning curves
Limited access to smartphones with efficient input methods
